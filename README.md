# Mostly Monochrome theme

I was interested in a theme that took advantage of the typographical capabilities of Operator Mono instead of colors. This started as a fork of [https://github.com/apex/apex-syntax].

Very WIP -- the code is a mess. I've pretty much only used it in TypeScript, no clue how it works elsewhere.
